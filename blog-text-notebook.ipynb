    "# Almost Perfect: A Discussion on Quasi-Experiments Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Quasi-experiments are experiments that leverage the principal from randomized tests, but are not equivalent\n",
    "\n",
    "Any technique that can be used to estimate causal effects from observational data can be used to extract the causal effect from an quasi-experiment. The use of these causal inferences techniques in quasi-experiments is the reduction in the variance and bias of the calculated ATT (or ATE), similarly to the effect these techniques in randomized experiments. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, one of the biggest problems with using causal inference techniques is that they inevevitably rely on assumptions about the causal links between variables. While there are advancements in causal discovery, in practice one never consider all possible configurations between cofounding, treatment, and target variables. Instead, we basically always create a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to lay out the causal relationships in such way that the scientists behind, their piers, and clients are satisfied with.\n",
